# DrawSuite
It is a software for drawing lines, circles, ellipses, curves, polygons and more! Currently under development. Written in C++ with GLUT and OpenGL.

What it does so far
===================

At the moment, this is only the core for what it's going to be the main application. I'm implementing the basic algorithms for primitive drawing, clipping, filling, and transformations. The tests of those algorithms are in the tests folder.

# Building
To compile all the project just type:
-> make

To run a test:
-> ./bin/tests/ANYTEST.c
